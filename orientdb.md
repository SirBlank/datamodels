What makes this database unique from the others is that it is a multi-model database, which combines different types of data models into one database engine.
* OrientDB databases can be hosted in the following ways: client/server, cloud, local, and embedded.
* Users can access the databases with Python by installing the PyOrient module. Users can access the databases with Java by installing the JDBC Driver.
